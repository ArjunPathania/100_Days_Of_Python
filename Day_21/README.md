## Day 21: Food, Collisions, Score, and Game Over

On Day 21, I enhanced the Snake Game with more features and functionality:

- **Food Generation**: Randomly generated food for the snake to "eat."
- **Collision Detection with Food**: Implemented logic to detect when the snake collides with the food, allowing the snake to grow and increasing the score.
- **Extending the Snake Body**: Every time the snake eats food, its body extends by one segment.
- **Wall Collision Detection**: Implemented game-over logic for when the snake hits the screen boundaries.
- **Tail Collision Detection**: Added functionality to detect if the snake collides with its own tail, triggering the game-over state.
- **Scoreboard**: Created a scoreboard to keep track of the playerâ€™s score.
- **Restart Game**: After the game ends, players can choose to restart the game by providing input.

This project demonstrates the power of OOP in organizing code efficiently and how various programming concepts like event handling, collision detection, and game loops can be applied to create a simple but engaging game.
