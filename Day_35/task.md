# Task: Weather Alert with Twilio Integration

## Objective:
To create a weather alert system that checks the weather forecast for a given location and sends an SMS notification if it's expected to rain within the next few hours.

## Steps:
1. **Fetch Weather Data:**
   - Use the OpenWeatherMap (OWM) API to get a weather forecast for the next few hours.
   - Extract weather conditions, specifically checking if it will rain (weather IDs less than 700 indicate rain).

2. **Twilio Integration:**
   - If the forecast predicts rain, send an SMS notification to the user via Twilio.
   - Use the Twilio `Client` object to send the SMS with a reminder to bring an umbrella.

## Requirements:
1. **Install required libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install requests twilio
   ```

1. **Set up environment variables:**
   - `OWM_API_KEY`: Your OpenWeatherMap API key.
   - `ACCOUNT_SID`: Your Twilio account SID.
   - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Twilio authentication token.
   - `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`: Your Twilio phone number.
   - `USER_PHONE_NUMBER`: The phone number to receive the SMS (in E.164 format).

2. **Code Implementation:**
   - Make a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to get the forecast.
   - Check the weather conditions to see if it will rain.
   - If rain is expected, send an SMS to the user using Twilio.

## Example:
- The code uses the following endpoint to fetch the weather forecast:
  ```
  https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast
  ```
- The SMS message is:
  ```
  "It's going to rain today. Remember to bring an ☂️"
  ```

## Twilio SMS Sample:

[//]: # (```python)

[//]: # (from twilio.rest import Client)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (# Send SMS)

[//]: # (client = Client&#40;account_sid, auth_token&#41;)

[//]: # (message = client.messages.create&#40;)

[//]: # (    body="It's going to rain today. Remember to bring an ☂️",)

[//]: # (    from_="YOUR_TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER",)

[//]: # (    to="USER_PHONE_NUMBER")

[//]: # (&#41;)

[//]: # (print&#40;message.status&#41;)

[//]: # (```)

## Deliverables:
1. Python script for weather monitoring and SMS sending.
2. Instructions on setting up the necessary API keys and environment variables.
