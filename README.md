# 100 Days of Python - Projects & Learning 🚀

Welcome to my **100 Days of Python** repository! 🎉

This repo will serve as a collection of all the projects and code I create during my 100 days of learning Python. The goal is to build real-world applications, enhance my programming skills, and dive deeper into data science, AI, and other interesting areas of Python.

## 📅 Challenge Overview

**Start Date:** : **28 September 2024**

I'm committed to coding every day for 100 days, creating meaningful projects and solving problems. The journey will involve:

- 📂 Building Projects
- 💡 Solving Problems
- 🔍 Exploring Data Science & AI concepts
- 📖 Documenting Learning

## 📁 Folder Structure

The repository will be organized into different sections:

- `Day_1_to_Day_10`: Basic Python scripts, solving coding challenges, and exploring beginner-level topics.
- `Day_11_to_Day_20`: Intermediate projects, deeper into Python libraries, and more complex problems.
- `Day_21_to_Day_30`: Data Science basics, working with libraries like Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib.
- `Day_31_to_Day_50`: Machine Learning models, exploring Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and similar tools.
- `Day_51_to_Day_70`: Building full-fledged projects, integrating APIs, automation.
- `Day_71_to_Day_100`: Advanced Python topics, AI, Data Science projects, and real-world applications.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

Throughout the challenge, I will be working with:

- **Python**: Core language
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and repository management
- **Data Science Tools**: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Web Scraping & Automation**: BeautifulSoup, Selenium
- **APIs**: Integrating external services into Python projects

## 📜 Documentation

Each day's project will be documented with:

- A brief description of the project/problem.
- The code, organized into separate folders for each day.
- Insights and takeaways learned from the task.
- Resources/references used during the challenge.

## 🚀 Goals

- Enhance my Python skills and deepen my understanding of various libraries.
- Build a strong foundation in Data Science and AI (my primary field of interest).
- Create a portfolio of projects to showcase my learning journey.
