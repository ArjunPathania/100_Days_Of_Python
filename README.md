# 100 Days of Python

Welcome to my **100 Days of Python** challenge! 🚀

This repository documents my journey of learning Python, enhancing problem-solving skills, and building projects to strengthen my foundation as a data scientist.

---

## 🛠️ Purpose
- Develop a deeper understanding of Python.
- Solve diverse programming problems.
- Build practical projects relevant to data science.
- Track my progress and growth over 100 days.

## 📅 Challenge Structure

Each day includes:
1. **Learning:** A new concept or topic in Python.
2. **Problem-Solving:** Solving coding problems or challenges.
3. **Project Work:** Incremental progress on data science or general Python projects.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/100_Days_Of_Python.git
cd 100_ays_Of_Python
```

### Install Dependencies (only for specific projects install requirements as you go)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

### Run Python Scripts (only an example)
Navigate to any day's folder and run the script.
```bash
python main.py 
```

## 📝 Logs
- **Day 1:** Learned variables, data types, and practiced basic I/O operations.
- **Day 2:** Explored control flow using `if-else` statements and loops.
- *(Logs will be updated daily)*
