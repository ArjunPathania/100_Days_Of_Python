# 100 Days of Python - Projects & Learning 🚀

Welcome to my **100 Days of Python** repository! 🎉

This repo will serve as a collection of all the projects and code I create during my 100 days of learning Python. The goal is to build real-world applications, enhance my programming skills, and dive deeper into data science, AI, and other interesting areas of Python.

## 📅 Challenge Overview

**Start Date:** : **28 September 2024**

I'm committed to coding every day for 100 days, creating meaningful projects and solving problems. The journey will involve:

- 📂 Building Projects
- 💡 Solving Problems
- 🔍 Exploring Data Science & AI concepts
- 📖 Documenting Learning

## 📁 Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders for each day of the challenge. Each folder is named according to the format `Day_[day]` (e.g., `Day_1`, `Day_2`, etc.), and it contains:

- The project or script of the day.
- A `README.md` file (if necessary) explaining the task or project.
- Any resources or references used.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

Throughout the challenge, I will be working with:

- **Python**: Core language
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and repository management
- **Data Science Tools**: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Web Scraping & Automation**: BeautifulSoup, Selenium
- **APIs**: Integrating external services into Python projects

## 📜 Documentation

Each day's project will be documented with:

- A brief description of the project/problem.
- The code, organized into separate folders for each day.
- Insights and takeaways learned from the task.
- Resources/references used during the challenge.

## 🚀 Goals

- Enhance my Python skills and deepen my understanding of various libraries.
- Build a strong foundation in Data Science and AI (my primary field of interest).
- Create a portfolio of projects to showcase my learning journey.
