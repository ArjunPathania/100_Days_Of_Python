# 100 Days of Python - Day 20 & 21: Snake Game

## Day 20: Building the Snake Body and Movement

On Day 20, I started working on a classic **Snake Game** using the **Turtle library** in Python. The main tasks accomplished were:

- **Creating the Snake Body**: The initial snake body was made using turtle objects and rendered on the screen.
- **Updating the Snake**: Developed a method to dynamically update the snake body as the game progresses.
- **Snake Movement**: Implemented the logic to move the snake across the screen.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Approach**: The code was refactored to follow OOP principles, making the snake an object with its own attributes and methods.
- **Handling User Inputs**: Defined controls for moving the snake in different directions (up, down, left, right).
